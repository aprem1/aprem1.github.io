## About Me

I am a theoretical physicist, working primarily on topological states of matter, including symmetry-protected and fractonic phases, and on the dynamics of strongly interacting quantum systems, both in and out of equilibrium. I am also interested in generalised notions of symmetry and their applications to many-body quantum systems and quantum information processing.
